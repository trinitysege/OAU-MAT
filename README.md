# OAU-MAT
A Near Real-Time Meteorological Data Depository for Atmospheric Research in Africa

Executive Summary:
This project is aimed at the development of a remotely accessible meteorological data
depository from an online server located at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU). Using
resources based on existing RENs this facility will allow researchers anywhere in the world
to download reliable atmospheric data (in near real-time) from an array of low-cost automatic
(and autonomous) weather stations to be deployed across Nigeria. This online database will
be useful for the study of the atmospheric phenomena (regional climate modelling, aerosol
loading and pollution, etc.).
